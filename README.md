# AI-Digit-Recognizer
This project is a Deep Learning application developed as part of my MCA curriculum. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify handwritten digits (0-9) with high accuracy.

🚀 Features
Interactive Canvas: Users can draw digits directly on a web interface using their mouse.

Real-time Prediction: The AI model predicts the digit instantly after drawing.

Deep Learning Engine: Built using a custom CNN architecture with PyTorch.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Deep Learning Framework: PyTorch

Web App Framework: Streamlit

Libraries: NumPy, Torchvision, Matplotlib

📂 Project Structure
app.py: The main Streamlit application file containing the UI and model loading logic.

mera_digit_model.pth: The trained weights of the CNN model.

MNIST_project.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and training process.


💻 How to Setup Locally
